									<h2>"Hey, did you hear that?" Understanding the Science of Sound</h2>
									<h4 style="color: grey;">03 July 2024</h4>
									<p>We all know what sound is. Don't we? In school, we may have learned that sound waves are produced by vibrations that travel through the air. When these vibrations each our ears, we hear sound. But our <i>perception</i> of sound is influenced by more than just these vibrations. What we perceive is shaped by what we know, what we see, and even what we expect. Jointly with <a href="https://thesis.psychologyresearch.co.uk/equality-diversity-resources/">Dr. Matke-Bauer</a>, Dr. Symons led interactive demonstrations exploring the science of sound at this year's <a href = "https://royalholloway.ac.uk/science-festival/">Royal Holloway Science Festival</a>. A big thank you to all the children of all ages who stopped by! Check out the video below to learn more about the Science Festival. And if you look closely, you may even spot one of our demos!</p>
